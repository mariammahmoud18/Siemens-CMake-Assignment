## Siemens-CMake-Assignment
A project build done using MakeFiles and CMake.
The project consists of main.cpp, core.cpp and calc.cpp. It has two versions where each versions is linked differently to the other class.

# First Part:
Statically link calc.cpp library to core.cpp. Then, dynamically link core.cpp library to main.cpp.

# Second Part:
Dynamically link calc.cpp library to core.cpp. Then, dynamically link core.cpp library to main.cpp.

The project build is done using both hand-written Makefiles and automatically-written Makefiles using CMake.
